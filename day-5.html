Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

There are two display values: block and inline.


*********************************************** Block Elements *******************************************


A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

some examples:

(1) ul
(2) div
(3) footer
(4) header
(5) hr
(6) table
(7) form
(8) nav 
(9) main
(10) section

*********************************************** Inline Elements ****************************************************

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

(1) a
(2) span
(3) b
(4) label
(5) small
(6) button
(7) img
(8) select
(9) strong
